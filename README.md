# atom-isin-code package

The ISIN code atom package let's you lookup the name of a security based on its ISIN code.

## How it works

1. Activate the package by using `ctrl-alt-a`
1. Select a valid [ISIN code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Securities_Identification_Number#Description). You should see a tooltip with the security name.
1. If you want to deactivate the package, use `ctrl-alt-a` again.
